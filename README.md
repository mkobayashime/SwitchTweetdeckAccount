## Features

Add keyboard shortcuts to quickly select account to tweet from in TweetDeck

Add keyboard shortcuts to quickly select account to tweet/retweet from in TweetDeck.

"Shift + 1", "Shift + 2", ... "Shift + 0" are for 1st, 2nd, ...10th account.

When tweet panel is closed: Creates a new tweet with corresponding account.
When tweet panel is opened: Selects corresponding account.

Tips: "Alt+Enter" to quote in the retweet/quote modal, in addition to the native "Ctrl+Enter" for retweeting.

Tips: Since shortcut keys don't work when the input area is focused, you can hit "Escape" before the shortcut key, and then hit "n" for re-focus on the input area.
